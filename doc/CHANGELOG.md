## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Orthogonal Projection for Medical Visualization**: Implemented orthogonal projection as the default projection type for 3D mesh rendering to ensure accurate dimensional representation without perspective distortion
  - Added `ProjectionType` enum with `Perspective` and `Orthogonal` variants
  - Enhanced `Camera` struct with orthogonal projection parameters (`ortho_left`, `ortho_right`, `ortho_bottom`, `ortho_top`)
  - Implemented orthogonal projection matrix calculation with automatic aspect ratio handling
  - Added `Camera::new_perspective()` method for backward compatibility
  - Updated default uniforms in `MeshRenderContext` to use orthogonal projection
  - Created comprehensive documentation in `doc/orthogonal-projection-implementation.md`

- **Buffer Lifecycle Management**: Implemented comprehensive buffer cleanup to prevent "Buffer does not exist" errors during mesh mode toggling
  - Added `Drop` implementations for `BasicMeshContext` and `MeshView` with debug logging
  - Added `clear_mesh_context_cache()` method to `State` for explicit cache clearing
  - Added `clear_depth_view()` method to `TexturePool` for depth texture cleanup
  - Enhanced graphics context swapping to clear mesh resources and prevent stale references
  - Created detailed documentation in `doc/buffer-lifecycle-fix.md`

### Changed
- **Default Camera Projection**: `Camera::new()` now defaults to orthogonal projection instead of perspective projection for medical accuracy
- **Fallback Rendering**: Default uniform calculations now use orthogonal projection for consistency

### Technical Details
- Orthogonal projection maintains object size regardless of distance from viewer
- Automatic aspect ratio preservation prevents distortion
- Cross-platform compatibility verified (native and WASM builds)
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing perspective projection use cases
- Performance optimized with simpler matrix calculations compared to perspective projection

### Documentation
- Added detailed implementation guide for orthogonal projection
- Updated function-level comments to reflect orthogonal projection usage
- Documented benefits for medical visualization applications
